abstract: Contributed to experiments for a paper currently under submission to CVPR on concept-dictionary safety defenses in VLA models. Maintain and extend PyTorch experimental pipeline for concept-dictionary learning and activation-space defenses. Run large-scale experiments and ablations; ensure cross-environment reproducibility via strict logging and configuration. Curate multilingual datasets and design evaluation settings for safety under adversarial or out-of-distribution prompts.
